# Dodger-Alert 

Launch the app from the Terminal:
$ node server.js

## Notes
This app has some limitations. Because of the unpredictability of baseball, (unlike other sports where there is a time limit), it is difficult to accurately assess the time of when the game ends. Thus, I set the final score to be sent out 4 hours after the game starts (1 hour more than league average).
